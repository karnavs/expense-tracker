# 💰 Expense Tracker Web Application

A modern, responsive, and scalable expense tracking web application built using **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, designed with real-world software architecture practices.

This project demonstrates strong frontend engineering fundamentals, state management, persistence handling, UI/UX thinking, and production-level project structuring — with backend integration planned using **Spring Boot**.
